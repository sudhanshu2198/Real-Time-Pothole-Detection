# Real Time Pothole Detection

Potholes are symptoms of a poorly maintained road, pointing to an underlying structural issue. A vehicle's impact with a pothole not only makes for an uncomfortable journey, but it can also cause damage to the vehicle's wheels, tyres and suspension system resulting in high repair bills.

Different model architecture and backnones are utilizes for pothole detection
- FasterRCNN with Resnet: .6802 map @ iou=0.5
- SSD with Vgg : .5642 map @ iou=0.5
- SSDLite with MobileNetv3: .453 @ iou=0.5
- Yolov8m: 0.38 @ iou=0.5

Though FasterRCNN and SSD performs better but they have significantly slower speed then SSDLite model , due to which SSDLite Model with Mobilenetv3 backbone is deployed in the Streamlit as pothole detection model.
